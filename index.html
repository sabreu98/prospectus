	<p>“Why does it help to read others' stories? It's not only that misery loves company, because (I learned) misery is too self-absorbed to want much company. Others' experiences helped with my emotional struggle; reading, I felt a little less crazy.” <em id="cursive">David Sheff</em></p>
	<p class="p1">My family hid my brother’s addiction from me for years. My understanding of what my brother was going through started at one bad drug trip he had in 2015 and ended at a debilitating cycle of schizophrenic episodes — little did I know that these episodes were part of a larger struggle of drug abuse. Not only do loved ones hide their struggles of addiction outside the built up walls of the immediate family circle, they also hide within the family as well. Within these silent echoes of addiction is where loved ones sit in emotional trenches. You hide, and you hope and you follow all the do’s and don’ts only to see your efforts fall short every single time. How can we break this cycle of silent suffering?</p1>

<section class="research">
	<p>Drug overdose is the leading cause of death for people under 50 in the United States. 19.7 million people in the U.S struggle with a substance use disorder, and only 1.4 million of those people seek treatment. <br><em id="cursive">American Addiction Centers, 2020</em> </p>
	<p class=p1> The statistics are extreme and exponentially growing, yet what sits idle is the growing need for support of those that are finding themselves time and time again at a loss for how to help their loved one. I’ve taken apart articles and research — watched doctors and therapists explain the do’s and don’ts of being a loved one to someone battling addiction. But what this research doesn’t prepare you for is the emotional wreckage of the journey, and the constant hopeless realization that there is nothing you can do. There is no explaining in scientific terms the heartache and misery those that care for addicts go through.</p>

	<p><br>Talking at a meeting is a step in the right direction towards coming to terms with how these struggles are affecting your life — yet when one leaves a meeting they go back to hiding, to being ashamed. I think this community needs to start questioning and discussing if this kind of anonymity is actually protecting or harming themselves.</p>

	<p>“Anyone who has lived through it, or those who are now living through it, knows that caring about an addict is as complex and fraught and debilitating as addiction itself.” <em id="cursive">David  Sheff</em></p>
<p class="p1">This quote and idea is a really massive thing for loved ones of addicts to wrap their heads around. Because when you see someone you care about fall out of control, the last thing you think about is what that is doing to yourself. But what I realized is that during the absolute worst relapses and episodes the one battling substance abuse, at least when high, has this momentary respite from their suffering - which is one of the reasons why they fall into this cycle of addiction because it numbs them from things they’re not ready to face. The ones that care for addicts and that are there during the worst days are completely sober - and so there’s this emotional sometimes physical trauma that loved ones go through that you push away because it feels selfish to acknowledge it. </p>

<p class="p1">This project is for those like my family and myself. It is for mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, partners, friends — it is for loved ones of those struggling with substance abuse. It is for those that feel isolated and that need support, those that don’t know what they need but want to know they are not alone, for those that are not quite ready to be vulnerable and for those that are. </p>

	<p class="p1">This website will be more than just a blog or a facebook group. It will be a virtual space dedicated to and encouraged by vulnerable, strong voices. For Their Loved Ones will be a space where fathers can find stories told by other fathers, a space where a mother can seek comfort in hearing the voice of another mother, where a partner can connect with other partners that know exactly what they are going through. This online platform will be built on and supported by a community ready to bring to light their important story.</p>
